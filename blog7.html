  <p>Imagine it is the year 2090 and you are telling the tale of Covid-19 to your grandchildren. Write about the unfolding of the events from your perspective and comment on how things made you feel.</p>

<p>My second year of University, about 2 months into a year shaping up to be a hellscape. On January 2nd, Australia was on fire. January 3rd, talks of World War III happening. Slowly but surely this year would throw trial after trial at the world. However, the biggest threat remains undetected, COVID-19. COVID-19 got its name from a shortening of the phrase Coronavirus Disease 2019. Having it come from 2019 is a whole new concern. This virus was floating around the world infecting people while Australia was still burning.</p>

<p>This virus tears apart your lungs bit by bit, going so far as to infect the very antibodies trying to stop it. After successfully defeating this virus your lungs are injured and your immune system all but spent. If any other virus or bacteria would attack you, it would almost certainly cause death.</p>

<p>So what to do? How do we stop it? Everyone has been ordered to quarantine themselves, and should they go out they practice social distancing. Staying at home seems lovely until you realize your parents are 65. COVID-19 hits the elderly and immunocompromised the hardest, going home risks spreading it to my parents. I cannot go home. I am alone at UTM. No one around to talk to, no one around to interact with, only myself.</p>

<p>Staying home alone with no parents sounds like a blessing. No one around to tell you what to do, no one around to tell you no, you can invite your friends over for a party... Except you can't, everyone has been ordered to stay home. Everyone is at home with their family, everyone is interacting with others, staving off loneliness and holding onto what little normalcy is left. I'm alone, my friends nothing more than text on a screen, my daily life thrust into the unknown. The campus is shut down, only one food place remains, my sleep schedule has gone fully nocturnal, everything is going wrong.</p>

<p>So what is there to do when you're alone? Make your own fun. I've been playing co-op games solo, controlling all the players. Ironically Pandemic has been my go-to game for this. Asking the question of "What happens if I put this in my espresso machine?" Most likely the answer is something bad. Relax, it's only the end of the world. When all that fails, learn. Learn as much as you can. Not just school subjects, but how to make food. Fail faster so that you can learn better. Come out of this pandemic stronger. Learn another language, I've been studying Japanese in this trying time. Continuing my 5-year journey through this ideographic language. Particles for parts of speech, three distinct writing systems, differing pronunciations depending on the context, a pictographic script with endless complexity. Start with some grammar, work onto some words, finish with some new kanji. Every day a little more, eventually we will overcome it. One day, one step. 一日一歩。</p>
