<p>For Presentation 1, my group &emdash; Nameless &emdash; chose the game <em>Ticket to Ride</em> to present. It is a very well done eurogame that has a lot of good mechanics built into it. Describing it in more detail, it is a mapping oriented, victory point, finite resources, eurogame. Victory points are easy to earn with a risk and reward mechanic built into some parts of it. Overall a very good game to present.</p>

<p>We started off by playing the game. We had a good game with each player playing a different strategy, and a close score at that. The <em>Longest Route</em> decided the game, the difference between lengths being <strong>one</strong> train-car. We had a very easy time getting up to speed with the game, and the internal mechanics allowed us to get a few strategic principles down which we would later go on to present.</p>

<p>After that we met up later to work on the rough outline of the presentation. We had a good brainstorming session where we got the critical components of our presentation down and ordered, then focussed on fleshing them out more in the future. This fleshing out was done more independantly. Next time I would want to have another meeting to go over the fleshing out together as a group. </p>

<p>As for the content and the explanation of our game, it wasn't too hard to explain the general idea and overarching mechanics. The real problem came from wording the finnicky bits of the game. One of the hardest things to word was an example of how to build train lines. To summarize the mechanic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have to play n cards of the line colour to build on a train line of that colour, however you can use a rainbow train card to stand in for any of them, and if the train line has no colour you just need to play n cards of the same colour <em>(rainbow train replacement works here too)</em> to build there. Additionally if there are two lines running parallel for the same route, one player may not claim oth routes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Getting the full explanation of that rule into our presentation, while having a more visual theme, and keeping it short, was a really big challenge. Even then there were other rules that gave us the same problem to solve.</p>

<p>Then there was the presentation itself, I did most of the content for the presentation in terms of the text. However at 4 am the previous night one of my groupmates did a full visual overhaul of our slides, and I needed to change mine to match. Most of the text written became deleted. Having more of a defined visual theme and communicating that to everyone would be useful for the next presentation.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a good game to choose, had a lot of depth to it in explanation, was a fun experience to play, and our group worked well together to make a functional presentation. I would have chosen a different eurogame personally, likely Pandemic, but it worked out well in the end for everyone.</p>
