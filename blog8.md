CSC290 &mdash; The English for Computer Science Students.

At first glance, this course seems like a hastily cobbled together amalgam of other English and Writing courses. Just like Statistics for Biology students, Calculus for Economics students, or any other STEM Field for a discipline needing just a bit of that knowledge. However, it is not just that. It is a hyperspecialized course designed to teach the fundamentals of how to write well but that doesn't capture all of what this course does.

We had weekly blog posts to write; get a topic, write some number of words on it. It was the typical writing journal expected in any English course centred on writing. Except there was more to it. The submission just had to be an online link to a blog post. We were never restricted on how we had to put them online. So I learned how to make a website from scratch, How to use a Github repository to host this site, How to compile markdown to HTML, how CSS is just painful. Each critique of my posts gave me more information on how my writing can still improve, slowly but surely it did. Barely passing on [Blog 2](./blog2.html) to getting 100% on [Blog 7](./blog7.html).

Then came the Midterm, a test of our understanding of course material up to that point. Instead of being tested on our ability to understand logical fallacies through many examples, we were tasked to use structures to write item after item. Is this grammatically correct? Is this sentence correctly using a semicolon? Does this fit the five-paragraph structure? What caught me off guard the most was the task of generating two slides conveying how one can win in a game of Tic-tac-toe. We had a presentation that cared about us explaining a game to people who have never played it. Doing that on a midterm where the course felt like logical disassembly of arguments was not expected.

We had two presentations throughout the year, we could not choose our groups. Our presentations were to explain things to an audience who has not heard of it before. One board game and one algorithm. It went surprisingly well, we wrote about a post-mortem for our first presentation in [Blog 5](./blog5.html). Then COVID-19 hit, the school closed and the course continued as best it could online. Presentations became youtube videos, lectures became Zoom calls, everything went digital. Our presentation on Huffman Encoding turned to be a youtube video lecture with a slideshow in the background.

We had to then critically review a scholarly article with another scholarly article as a source. I left myself with relatively little time to finish it, I left myself with a big problem. I skimmed the articles and chose the first one to critique, but each time I tried to read it statistical distributions and numbers broke sentence flow too much to understand what was going on. By the time I understood the article I had a little under a day to tear it to shreds in a scholarly manner.

That was when this finally clicked. Each new lecture, each new assignment, each new blog post, I was surprised. I underestimated this course and what it would get me. That is the big lesson here. I walked in on my first day of lecture and immediately stopped paying attention, it felt easy and free if you just read the slides. This course was teaching you English, but it was also teaching you to never underestimate things. This course was more than it seemed to be under the surface, and through struggling with this course I learned to stop underestimating it.

This course did give me useful tools in understanding how my writing can improve, one look through [all my blogs](./index.html) will tell you that much. Logical fallacies are everywhere and easy to accidentally fall into, that one lecture was very informative for structuring a good argument. The five-paragraph structure was touched on in lecture to give us an idea of how an essay generally wants to work. Thesis at the top, list your points, write about them in that order, finish with a conclusion. Quick and easy to use and manipulate to the point where you want it. The weekly tutorials helped reinforce the topics covered in lecture and it showed. However as said earlier, the most important lesson I learned through this course was to never underestimate a course like this. Never underestimate what you can learn from a course, no matter how simplistic and trivial it looks on the outside.
