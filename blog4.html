<h1>Blog 4 - Japanese Innovation</h1>

<ul>
<li>You must watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liyFKUFCQno&amp;t=238s">following video</a> and use the five paragraph model found therein That is your blog must have:
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong>: State your position clearly and outline your three main arguments.</li>
<li><strong>Three support paragraphs</strong>: Support your three main arguments in individual paragraphs</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Drop the mike (so to speak); conclude your premise.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The purpose of this blog post is to practice making arguments with written prose.
You will take the position "cats are better than dogs" (or vice-versa) and argue your case.  As this is entirely opinion-based your supporting clauses will be mostly anecdotal, but feel free to use actual data if you can find it.
Focus on structuring your argument properly rather than how everything sounds. Strive to make your arguments concise.
You may also substitute "cats v dogs" with other matchups like:  Mac V PC,  Pie V Cake,  Hotdogs V Hamburgers.  Just keep in mind your audience (in this case the TAs).</p>

<p>This document will be using the <a href="http://ooyamaneko.net/download/mahjong/riichi/World_Riichi_Championship_Rules_2015_en.pdf">World Riichi Championship</a> <em>(Japanese)</em> and contrasting it to the <a href="http://mahjong-europe.org/portal/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=167">Mahjong Competition Rules</a> <em>(Chinese)</em> ruleset.</p>

<p>Additionally, this document will have the Japanese original form of things next to certain words. They are, in most cases, the written form of the most vocalized version of the things the English is referring to. This is as I use the English form of hands in this blog post and would like to leave resources to those wishing to know more.</p>

<p>Japan has done a lot of innovation in many fields. Nintendo has revolutionized video games, and according to some, it saved the gaming industry. Animation has become a deeper field due to the sheer scale of some Anime. The rhythm game industry has most of its titles from Japan. This is largely due to its work ethic, always give one-hundred percent effort in your work. Nintendo has done other innovations recently. Going back to their roots as a card game company, they released a new Mahjong set recently. The Yakuman Phoenix <jp><em>「役満鳳凰」</em></jp> Mahjong set. It has a classical design but has many improvements over a typical set, and is widely considered to be the best hand-shuffle set out there. They have made an innovation in the field of Mahjong. This brings me to my main point, I'm here to argue that Japanese <em>(Riichi)</em> Mahjong is better than Chinese <em>(MCR)</em> Mahjong.</p>

<p>Firstly the game has far fewer hands and point-generating concepts to remember. Chinese has eighty-one ways to generate points, and some preclude others from being scored. Japanese has 42 ways to generate points, three of which are not usable for the completion of a point minimum. The actual need to know all of them is not too critical as some of them rarely come up. Take for example All Green <jp><em>「緑一色」</em></jp>, it requires your hand to be built from tiles with only green on them. Another would be Three Quads <jp><em>「三槓子」</em></jp>, you need three quads in your winning hand. In the end, there are very few hands needed to know to get up to speed and playing.</p>

<p>Given this small hand-pool to pull from, it allows you to get more mechanical depth in the small sets of hands you have. The game asks you to infer players' plans from their discards, over just trying to call as much and as fast as you can. The game is designed to want you to keep hands closed as much as possible and from there you develop a lot more tile efficiency with Riichi's signature rules, Riichi <jp><em>「立直」</em></jp> and Furiten <jp><em>「振聴」</em></jp>. The former making any closed hand valid, and interacting with a luck mechanic positively. The latter allowing you to infer hands from discards far stronger. Formally, Furiten states that: "One may not win off another's discarded tile if one of their winning tiles is amongst their discards". It allows people to play around others' hands much stronger and set traps in their discards for others to fall for. MCR lacks both of these concepts and for that, it devolves into calling anything and everything you would need.</p>

<p>Finally, the knowledge gained from Riichi is backwards compatible with MCR. The more advanced understanding of closed hands you get from Riichi is strong for MCR. You can keep yourself closed with more defensive power against opponents opening themselves up at a moment's notice. Additionally, the hands seen in Riichi are mostly in MCR themselves, under their anglicized name. So your knowledge of Riichi's hands allows you to jump right into a game of MCR not completely blind. Finally, the addition of flowers in MCR is not too big a mechanical difference, to the point an equivalent mechanic is found in 3-man Mahjong <jp><em>「三麻」</em></jp>.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Riichi Mahjong is better than MCR Mahjong. Not only because the number of hands is fewer, and it is backwards compatible; because Riichi has strictly more mechanical depth than MCR. Therefore it is strictly better overall.</p>
