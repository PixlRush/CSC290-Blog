<h1>Blog 3 - Pulling Profit out of a Hat</h1>

<ul>
<li>State the authors claim and outline their grounds in your introductory paragraph.</li>
<li>Argue the source text contains a fallacy or fallacies by quoting the source text directly and identify which fallacy has been committed.  (Limit yourself to fallacies from the lecture slides.)</li>
<li>In you conclusion explain what hinges on the logical fallacy that ultimately invalidates the author's arguments.</li>
<li>Provide a link to the article you are critiquing at end.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>During Lecture 3, numerous logical fallacies of informal reasoning were introduced.  Find a news article, blog, or scientific paper (the more recent and prestigious the source the better) that commits (in your opinion) at least one logical fallacy that invalidates their argument.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What if you could harness the power of technology to transform education forever? How can it be done? Tophat argues that technology is a tool to enhance learning to bring it to an entire new tier of effectiveness. They argue that educators do more than <em>"simply ‘tolerate’ it"</em>.</p>

<p>Tophat makes some amazing points in their article. It makes such an argument for the accessibility technology grants; however, they are simply not the company to make that argument. They have a very strong argument as shown below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Rather than memorizing facts, they learn by doing. This could be as simple as taking an interactive quiz in class or participating in tech-enabled group discussions or as involved as playing educational games, practicing science experiments in a virtual lab or taking a virtual field trip."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, like the iClicker, Tophat sells a subscription-based service that functions <strong>near-identically</strong> to an iClicker. Take a look at the above quote once more with the knowledge of what Tophat's business model is. Nothing screams conflict of interest louder than a company selling a browser-based in-class evaluation service talking about the impact of <em>"taking an interactive quiz in class"</em>. This is a textbook example to use for this fallacy.</p>

<p>Further down they state in their conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Instructors can also use classroom response systems to assess students’ understanding of course material and adjust the pace or content as needed in real time."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This further cements the conflict of interest. They cite <em>"classroom response systems"</em> specifically in the last line of their conclusion to drive home their point and generate new customers.</p>

<p>That is not all, there is a selection bias in place here. For such a question like <em>"How does Technology Impact Student Learning?"</em>, they manage to only touch on the positives. Their major points for their paragraphs are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li>Technology affords better access to resources</li>
<li>Technology can improve student engagement</li>
<li>Technology can expand classroom boundaries</li>
<li>Technology can encourage self-paced learning</li>
<li>Technology can promote innovative teaching techniques</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In <strong>none</strong> of these paragraphs does Tophat touch on the bad side of technology in the classroom. Asking instructors for a secondary or post-secondary course for their opinion on technology, they will definitely touch on the good parts; however, they will almost certainly touch on its bad side at least once. Tophat is clearly using a selection bias in the content of their article, reinforcing my point about conflict of interest.</p>

<p>To conclude, this article is a textbook example of conflict of interest, with a bit of selection bias thrown in. There are two major sections where Tophat praises the utility of classroom response systems, when they sell such a service. Additionally they never touch on the bad side of technology, only the good.</p>
