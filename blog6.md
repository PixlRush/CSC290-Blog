This will be a summary of the plot of *My Little Pony; Friendship is Magic*. More specifically, I will be summarizing the plot in relation to the protagonist, Twilight Sparkle, throughout Seasons 1&ndash;3, the original length of the show. The Slice of Life nature of the show has a lot of overlapping arcs which gets as far down as an H-Plot whose summary would not be useful. Additionally, the nine seasons of content in addition to multiple other story beats through alternate media doesn't allow me to do it justice in 400&ndash;600 words.

*My Little Pony; Friendship is Magic* is a children's cartoon show about technicolour cartoon horses idealizing magic, friendship, and acceptance of all. However, the show goes deeper than just that. It is a slice of life show following the adventures of Twilight Sparkle and her friends as they go through their daily lives and occasionally save Equestria from major threats.

Twilight Sparkle is a unicorn studying advanced magic under Princess Celestia, the Monarch of Equestria. She comes across an old tome foretelling the return of Nightmare Moon, the former co-ruler alongside Princess Celesia turned dark. She promptly writes to Princess Celestia warning her of the upcoming return of Nightmare Moon. Princess Celestia just brushes her off, saying *"It's an old ponies' tale"*.

She is then instructed to go oversee the preparations for the Summer Solstice Celebration. Talking to the rest of the Main Cast &mdash; referred to as the mane six &mdash; to ensure their roles for the preparations are done.

They are as follows: Applejack, an apple farmer handling the food preparations for the Celebration; Rainbow Dash, a pegasus who is heading a team of others to control the weather for the day; Pinkie Pie, a bubbly pony assisting in the overarching celebration; Rarity, handling the major decorations for this celebration; and Fluttershy; ensuring that the woodland animals around the city are safe and sound.

After ensuring everything is alright, the Nightmare Moon from the *"old ponies' tale"* does escape her imprisonment. Twilight then goes off to defeat the old Monarch. She is then met by the rest of the mane six to face trials and tribulations before confronting, and ultimately defeating Nightmare Moon. They each are representatives of a singular Element of Harmony, an old magical relic that was used to imprison Nightmare Moon herself.

Everything is then treated as a typical slice of life, showing the daily adventures of our main cast. It picks up again at the start of the second season where they face yet another evil threat. This time in Discord, a villain who is the embodiment of chaos. Much like the same way that Nightmare Moon was defeated, and eventually reformed, by the mane six.

Next for Twilight, she meets a future her foretelling of some eventual problem a day from now. She tries to determine exactly what goes on but by trying desperately to find what's wrong she ends up causing the same problem she tried so hard to prevent. Learning in the process to not sweat the small stuff.

The second season focusses more on the individual members of the mane six as the season progresses. But the capstone of the second season and the beginning of the third presents a new villain, Queen Chrysalis. She impersonates the soon-to-be wife of Shining Armour, Twilight's older brother. The mane six eventually finds her out and oust her invasion plans after a heated battle that, honestly, should be viewed as an entire movie.

This then leads into what would've been the final season of the show. Closing off the first major arc for the mane six. Which then leads to the final episode of the third season. A magical spell somehow swaps the personalities of the mane six, and Twilight Sparkle must then undo it. Upon doing so, her mentor Princess Celestia has given her a promotion to the same level of royalty as her, to then train her up to become a ruler of the very same land Princess Celestia rules over.
