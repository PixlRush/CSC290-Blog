# Blog 3 - Pulling Profit out of a Hat

+ State the authors claim and outline their grounds in your introductory paragraph.
+ Argue the source text contains a fallacy or fallacies by quoting the source text directly and identify which fallacy has been committed.  (Limit yourself to fallacies from the lecture slides.)
+ In you conclusion explain what hinges on the logical fallacy that ultimately invalidates the author's arguments.
+ Provide a link to the article you are critiquing at end.

> During Lecture 3, numerous logical fallacies of informal reasoning were introduced.  Find a news article, blog, or scientific paper (the more recent and prestigious the source the better) that commits (in your opinion) at least one logical fallacy that invalidates their argument.

What if you could harness the power of technology to transform education forever? How can it be done? Tophat argues that technology is a tool to enhance learning to bring it to an entire new tier of effectiveness. They argue that educators do more than *"simply ‘tolerate’ it"*.

Tophat makes some amazing points in their article. It makes such an argument for the accessibility technology grants; however, they are simply not the company to make that argument. They have a very strong argument as shown below:

> "Rather than memorizing facts, they learn by doing. This could be as simple as taking an interactive quiz in class or participating in tech-enabled group discussions or as involved as playing educational games, practicing science experiments in a virtual lab or taking a virtual field trip."

Unfortunately, like the iClicker, Tophat sells a subscription-based service that functions **near-identically** to an iClicker. Take a look at the above quote once more with the knowledge of what Tophat's business model is. Nothing screams conflict of interest louder than a company selling a browser-based in-class evaluation service talking about the impact of *"taking an interactive quiz in class"*. This is a textbook example to use for this fallacy.

Further down they state in their conclusion:

> "Instructors can also use classroom response systems to assess students’ understanding of course material and adjust the pace or content as needed in real time."

This further cements the conflict of interest. They cite *"classroom response systems"* specifically in the last line of their conclusion to drive home their point and generate new customers.

To conclude, this article is a textbook example of conflict of interest. There are two major sections where Tophat praises the utility of classroom response systems, when they sell such a service.
